            updates
        </p>
        <p>whats up, so i added an about page that has links to my spotify and youtube so thats kinda cool, i also changed the background cause it was too much on my eyes. i also did
            a little of the art and videos page. i plan on doing contact and then the big fishing memes page hope your hype for that. sorry i didnt include last time but it will be out soon.
            new things and updates on this site. when i finsh this 3d model in blender i will share it. im also working on a new edit in premier as well ALSO trying to edit these letsplays
            and vlogs i been doing with my pals. also changed up the look of the boxs maybe they look better like this idk tbh. i added music but you gotta press play i couldnt get autoplay
            to work cause of browser issues or sum. but you can still jam out! in the end check out the about and art/videos page. as i said i made this last night at like 3am so this 
            is just the start on how things look. i promise to make it look cooler soon. ok thats all goodbye.
